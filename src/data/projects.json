      "brief": "Connecting Scotland is a Community Interest Company that supports a growing network of trained practitioners that organise and delivers training practices in participatory leadership, hosting, and harvesting conversations.\n Connecting Scotland required a redesign and expansion to their preexisting site, allowing them to showcase events and previous work with clients. \n",
      "solution": "For the design, I utilised a simple theme as the foundation and began developing the bespoke features request on top of this foundation. \n I discovered from further discussions that the editors had trouble editing or adding any content to the site due to previous plugins installed. \n To solve this matter, I implemented advanced custom forms and designed inputs for every component on their site - giving editors freedom to add and update the site without programming experience. \n Custom blog post types were created, allowing Connecting Scotland to showcase their previous and work and upcoming events that they will host in the future.",

      "brief": "This brief was a college project as the final graded unit. Ultimately the goal of this brief was to showcase what I had learned throughout my college experience.\n National Museums Scotland is an organisation that cares for the collections of national and international importanceâ€”preserving them, interpreting them, and making them accessible to as many people as possible.\nNational Museums Scotland were looking for a solution that engaged communities and wanted features that would help communities organise and arrange events.",
      "solution": "For the National Museums of Scotland, I produced a modern, responsive website with a crucial focus on rich imagery to engage customers and showcase the museums featured events.\n A search and filter system was created, which allowed curious users to search the numerous events the National Museum of Scotland and refine their search until they found a suitable event.\n A booking system was built to allow the National Museum of Scotland to sell tickets to patrons. This system was split into easy to digest linear stages, which enabled a seamless booking and helped users feel less overwhelmed. Payment processing was made simple for customers by utilising the Stripe API on the back-end to handle payments.\n The final step of the user experience was sending customers their unique ticket generated as a PDF directly to their email for them to print off for their visit to the museum.",
