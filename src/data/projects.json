      "brief": "This brief was a college project as the final graded unit. Ultimately the goal of this brief was to showcase what I had learned throughout my college experience.\n National Museums Scotland is an organisation that cares for the collections of national and international importanceâ€”preserving them, interpreting them, and making them accessible to as many people as possible.\nNational Museums Scotland were looking for a solution that engaged communities and wanted features that would help communities organise and arrange events.",
      "solution": "For the National Museums of Scotland, I produced a modern, responsive website with a crucial focus on rich imagery to engage customers and showcase the museums featured events.\n A search and filter system was created, which allowed curious users to search the numerous events the National Museum of Scotland and refine their search until they found a suitable event.\n A booking system was built to allow the National Museum of Scotland to sell tickets to patrons. This system was split into easy to digest linear stages, which enabled a seamless booking and helped users feel less overwhelmed. Payment processing was made simple for customers by utilising the Stripe API on the back-end to handle payments.\n The final step of the user experience was sending customers their unique ticket generated as a PDF directly to their email for them to print off for their visit to the museum.",
